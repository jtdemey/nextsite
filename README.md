My homepage on Next.js and Express

## How to host my site on your machine
#### You'll need:
* Node.js >=v16.6.0
* NPM >=v7.19.1

#### 1) Clone this repository
First, you'll need the source code on your machine.
Open a terminal and run 'git clone https://github.com/jtdemey/nextsite.git' in a directory of your choice.
Alternatively, download the zip file from the 'Code' dropdown.

#### 2) Install dependencies
Navigate to the folder containing the cloned repository eg. 'cd /home/apps/nextsite'.
Run 'npm install'. This installs all the necessary NPM packages for hosting the website.

#### 3) Build the site
Run 'npm run build'.
This bundles the source code into optimized assets using Webpack and Babel.

#### 4) Start the Express server
Run 'npm run start'.

The site should now be running locally - open your favorite browser and go to http://localhost:3000/
